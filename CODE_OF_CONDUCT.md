## 🚨 Enforcement

### Reporting Issues

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by:

1. **Opening a confidential issue** on GitHub
2. **Contacting the project maintainers** directly via email at: `conduct@memeories.fake` (not a real email, please use GitHub)
3. **Reaching out** through GitHub Discussions

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly by the Principal Meme Architect and Chief Rotation Officer (the same two people).

### Privacy & Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with discretion. Project maintainers are obligated to:

- Maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter
- Provide updates on the investigation status
- Respect the privacy of all parties involved
- Store reports securely (in a zero-configuration manner)

### Investigation Process

Upon receiving a report, maintainers will:

1. **Acknowledge receipt** within 48 business hours (Denmark time)
2. **Review the incident** against this Code of Conduct
3. **Gather additional information** if needed
4. **Consult** with other maintainers (all one of them)
5. **Determine appropriate action** based on severity
6. **Communicate decision** to involved parties
7. **Document the incident** (using proper enterprise protocols)

### Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines:

#### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Minor violation, such as submitting a slightly low-quality meme or minor unprofessional language.

**Consequence**: Private written warning, clarification on why the behavior was inappropriate, and request for apology. Public clarification may be requested.

**Example**: "Your meme selection, while creative, doesn't meet our 1080p minimum resolution standard. Please review our quality guidelines."

#### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: Violation through a single incident or series of actions, such as repeatedly breaking Lighthouse score or hostile comments.

**Consequence**: Warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with involved parties for a specified period. Violating these terms may lead to temporary or permanent ban.

**Example**: "Your PR introduced 3 dependencies and broke our zero-dependency architecture. This is your official warning."

#### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: Serious violation, including sustained inappropriate behavior or harassment.

**Consequence**: Temporary ban from any interaction or public communication with the project for a specified period. No public or private interaction with community members during this period.

**Example**: "Persistent harassment of contributors results in a 30-day ban from the repository."

#### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Pattern of violation, severe harassment, or aggression toward individuals or groups.

**Consequence**: Permanent ban from all public interaction within the project community.

**Example**: "Continued discriminatory behavior after warnings results in permanent removal from the project."

#### 5. Meme Quality Violation
**Community Impact**: Submitting memes that violate our enterprise-grade quality standards (watermarks, poor resolution, copyright issues).

**Consequence**: Meme rejection with constructive feedback. Repeated violations may result in temporary inability to submit to `/images/` directory.

**Example**: "This 240p meme with a iFunny watermark does not align with our visual asset standards. Please review our contribution guidelines."

#### 6. Architecture Violation
**Community Impact**: Attempting to add configuration files, dependencies, or breaking the hot-reload algorithm.

**Consequence**: Immediate PR rejection with explanation of our architectural principles. Required reading of CONTRIBUTING.md.

**Example**: "Your PR adding package.json violates our core zero-dependency principle. Please review our architecture documentation."

## 💡 Philosophy

At Memeories™, we believe that:

- **Respect costs nothing** but delivers infinite ROI
- **Kindness scales** better than any algorithm
- **Humor and professionalism** can coexist beautifully
- **Diversity strengthens** our rotation paradigms
- **Everyone deserves** a harassment-free environment
- **Over-engineering is fun** when done with care
- **Perfect Lighthouse scores** are achievable through teamwork

We're building more than an image rotator—we're building a community. A slightly ridiculous, enterprise-focused, buzzword-laden community, but a community nonetheless.
